				<h2>The <strong>Problem</strong> we are solving</h2>
				<p>In Northern Italy, agricultural water usage is often inefficient, leading to significant water waste. Despite the availability of IoT solutions under Agriculture 4.0, the integration of AI for optimizing water use remains scarce. Inefficient irrigation practices not only lead to excessive water consumption but also impact crop health and yield, making it crucial to address these issues with innovative solutions. </p>

				<h2><strong>Solution</strong>: Long Short-Term Memory</h2>
				<p>AquaOpt utilizes a state-of-the-art LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) AI model to precisely forecast water needs. </p>
				<p>The LSTM model processes vast amounts of historical data, including weather patterns, soil moisture levels, and crop requirements in order to accurately forecast future water needs and adjust irrigation schedules accordingly.</p>
				<p>The model can be easily integrated with existing IoT sensors deployed in the field. </p>
